# Firewalls For Safety
## Firewalls can be Hard.

Understanding what the iptables do and how they work can be confusing, my hope is that through this program you can create rules a little faster and a little easier. I attempt to educate you with my help buttons on each step.
### GOAL
I want any user to be able to edit their firewalls with ease especially if you are new. Adding, Deleting, Editing will be easy and ofcourse a help button that explains a few of the basic commands. And of course some custom commands to run if you want to do some advanced work.

### SETUP
To set this program up please extract the folder somewhere on your computer, if you dont want to see the code /etc/FFS is a good choice. After extraction either run sudo FFS_Setup.sh or run the code inside the shell file. afterwords you will only need to run FirewallFS to run the TUI. Thank you for downloading.
